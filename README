Original Author's Caution:
Two points must be stressed about all the programs. Firstly they are simple examples which can be readily compiler, understood and altered, they are not necessarily the most efficient means of programming and a certainly not to be considered as examples of how to program. Secondly, although the examples are intendent to be robust, they are not idiot-proof. Extreme parameters (such as an R0 of several million) may cause spurious results.
